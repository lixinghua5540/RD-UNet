Title: *Bishift Networks for Thick Cloud Removal with Multitemporal Remote Sensing Images* <br>
***Introduction***<br>
<br>
Cloud detection in remote sensing images is a challenging task that plays a crucial role in various applications. A novel residual dual U-shape networks (RD-UNet) is proposed for cloud detection. The primary innovation lies in that it cascades two U-shaped networks and leverages a residual-like connection to enhance information flow between two networks, thus optimizing details and edge information. Moreover, another contribution is the introduction of improved skip connections (ISC), which efficiently facilitates multiscale feature utilization, aiding in the identification of thin clouds and distinguishing other confounding land features. The effectiveness of the proposed method was demonstrated through extensive experiments on two public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with an approximately 2% improvement in F1 score and superior visual effect for multispectral images.
